What is an FAQ Page?

An FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page is a key part of a knowledge base because it addresses the most common questions customers have and is useful to customers at all stages of the customer journey.

Why do you need an FAQ Page?
An FAQ page can help users navigate your site. Not only does an FAQ with links to related content provide your user with a deeper experience of your website, it also boosts your internal link-building, which is an important search ranking factor.

Does it improve the user experience of a website?
A well-written and well-designed FAQ page is a win-win for everyone. For your customers, it improves overall experience, both on your site and with the product or service you offer.
